# 2073. Time Needed to Buy Tickets

https://leetcode.com/problems/time-needed-to-buy-tickets

## Approach 1: Queue Simulation
`./1-queue-simulation.js`

### Explanation

We simulate the ticket buying process exactly as described:

1. The `tickets` array acts as a queue, where each element represents the number of tickets a person still needs to buy.
2. We repeatedly:

   * Remove the first person (`shift()`), decrement their ticket count, and increment the total time `res`.
   * If they still need tickets, add them back to the end of the queue.
3. Track `k` (the target person) by adjusting it after each operation:

   * If `k > 0`, decrement it since the target moves forward in the queue.
   * If `k == 0` and the current personâ€™s ticket count reaches `0`, stop and return `res`.
   * If `k == 0` but they still have tickets, set `k` to the last index of the queue after reinserting them.

### Time and Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n * m)` in the worst case

  * `n` = number of people, `m` = maximum tickets needed by a person.
  * Each `shift()` is `O(n)`, making it slower for large queues.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

  * Operates directly on the `tickets` array without extra storage.
