# 🧠 DSA Practice

This project is a personal collection of solved Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems — organized, testable, and easy to maintain.

For full `problems` folder structure, check: [/problems](./problems/readme.md)


## ⚙️ Setup

1. **Install Node.js** (v14 or higher)
2. Clone this repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/narsing-itkampalli/learn-dsa.git
    cd learn-dsa
    ```

3. Run any solution file to test:
   ```bash
   node problems/16-3Sum-Closest/brute-force.js
   ```



## ➕ Add a New Problem

You can create a new problem folder using this built-in command:

```bash
npm run add-problem "42. Trapping Rain Water"
```

This will:

* Create a new folder like: `problems/42-Trapping-Rain-Water`
* Add `testcases.js` and `README.md` as empty boilerplate files


## ✍️ Naming Conventions

* Folder: `[problemNumber]-[Title-In-Kebab-Case]`
* Solution files: Based on approach (e.g., `brute-force.js`, `sorting.js`)
* Test file: `testcases.js`
* Main test runner: `index.js` in `/problems`


## 📌 Goal

This project helps:

* Practice DSA consistently
* Keep code organized and testable
* Track different approaches per problem
* Build a strong portfolio of solved problems
