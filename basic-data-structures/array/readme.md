# Arrays

Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures in programming. They are a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations and can be accessed using their index.

## Array Time Complexities

| Operation        | Time Complexity |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Access           | O(1)            |
| Search           | O(n)            |
| Insertion (end)  | O(1)            |
| Insertion (middle/start) | O(n)    |
| Deletion         | O(n)            |
